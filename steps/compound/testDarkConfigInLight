short: testDarkConfigInLight
dependencies: darkConfig=one, darkConfig=two, light
cost: 1
required: yes
description::
This test is run twice, once for when darkConfig=one, and again for
darkConfig=two.  It is *not* run for darkConfig=three, although that compound
value is set.

Also note that while it requires the state 'light', the steps which provide
this state do not allow for it.  You'll see that because we have steps to both
enable and disable light, a sensible test pass can still be constructed and it
will select an optimal set of steps to configure the necessary prerequisites.
