Test App Notes
==============

 - When running tests, the tester is presented with a series of steps, each of
   which may be highlighted as 'current', and/or marked as 'done'.  Each step
   may also be 'failed'.

 - When running tests from the Android/iPhone app, configuration is
   deliberately limited.  Any configuration would be expected to happen on a
   master account.

 - The tester logs into their app using Google or Facebook credentials.
   Previously they should have logged into the test web site using these same
   credentials, and in this way they will automatically be assigned the correct
   test cases in the approriate test pass.

 - Each test step has a set of pre-requisite conditions, and a list of
   conditions that test will modify.  A test step need not modify any
   conditions, and it need not have any prerequisites.  These conditions take
   the form of arbitrary key/value pairs.  Examples might be:

    * OnAccess = off
    * OnAccess = on
    * ProductInstalled = <unset>
    * QuarantineEmpty = no
  
  - One condition value which may be set and queried will be equivalent to
    'unset'; as indicated above.
 
  - Each test step includes a 'difficulty' value; there may be a number of
    test steps all of which have equivalent pre-conditions and outcomes, and
    while all may be expected to be executed, one of these steps may need to be
    executed more than once in order to set up the right conditions for
    another test step.  This value helps to select the least expensive step
    which may be expected to simply change conditions

  - Each test step may include a flag indicating that it only exists to change
    the condition flags.  Such a test step is only included in a test pass if
    conditions need to be prepared for another test step.  Since any test step
    can set multiple conditions, this must be independent of the 'difficulty'
    value, and non-test steps may exist which perform the same task.  Obviously
    of two non-test tasks which modify the same conditions, only the least
    expensive will ever be executed.

  - Each test case may have arbitrary tags associated with them.  These are
    used to select steps which will be used to generate a suiteable test pass.

  - A test step will always have a manual description of the step necessary to
    perform the test; but may also be accompanied by automation instructions.
    How these automation steps will be executed is not known at this time, but
    will likely require a small test app running on the target system.  Where
    the test system is unable to execute a step automatically, the manual step
    will be performed instead.
